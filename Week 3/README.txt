All works for CS210 @ SNHU Week 3

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This assignment was to create a digital clock that displayed in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats at the same time. 

What did you do particularly well?

Getting the timing correct on this one was nice. Making sure that the screen refreshed after each clock tick. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

To enhance this project, I would like to get into OpenGL to create a 2D representation of this clock to make the visual better.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This in essence was a very very basic program. The basic skills in this program, however, will be used in all new projects that I get into. Setting correct includes, using good naming practices and function creation is be used throughout my learning and into my career. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I added a lot of fairly extensive comments in areas I thought that would be best explained.
