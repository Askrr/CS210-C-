Program is simple and flows in a logical order. The variables implied by my design are ON, OFF, PROGRAM, BREW, KEEP, SET, and ADD. These 7 variables should be able to cover everything for the short program. The main() function, as listed in the code, would be at start(). The others are already broken up into different functions. The psuedocode for me is easier to follow and turn into actual code instead of a flowchart. I like the look of actual code, with the indentations and sections setup instead of picturing how I will implement something from a chart.
		
brewCoffee():
	IF machine has water:
		BREW coffee
		KEEP warm 
		exit()
	ELSE IF machine doesn't have water:
		ADD water
		BREW coffee
		KEEP warm
		exit()
		
setTIME():
	SET hour
	SET minute
	IF press ON once more:
		SET time
		exit()
	ELSE if press PROGRAM:
		programTIME()
	ELSE if press OFF:
		exit()

programTime():
	IF press ON:
		start()
	ELSE IF press OFF:
		exit()
	ELSE:
		SET hour
		SET minute
		WAIT to predetermined time
		brewCoffee()

start(): (This is main function)
	IF press ON once:
		brewCoffee() FUNCTION
	ELSE IF press ON twice:
		setTime() FUNCTION
	ELSE IF press PROGRAM:
		programTime() FUNCTION
	ELSE:
		exit()

MACHINE off (exit())
